I have been contracted by Fred the Baker Baking Company to take a concept,
Donut Maker Clicker, from the drawing board to the browser. Fred the Baker is
tired of making real donuts and is ready to retire. He needed help to keep
his love of donuts alive. He wanted me to create a game that uses button clicks
to create virtual donuts for the world to enjoy. It's always "Time to make the
Donuts" and Fred is too busy to give us guidance on how to implement these
requirements. Luckily I have made this and it is fully functional.

For you own donuts or info on questions about this game, call 810-285-5555.
